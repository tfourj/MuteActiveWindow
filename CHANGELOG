- Added configurator to change config files easier.
- Added new muting method maw-muter.ahk (based on my fix for mute_current_application) (needs to be downloaded manually)
- Fix updatemaw.bat updating if auto-updates are disabled
- Add CTRL+ALT+O to rerun script as administrator
- Implement UseHook to get keybind in some games.

(OLDER RELEASE)
- Move updater to .ahk script directly(1 .bat updater still exists)
- Unnecessary files get removed with updates now.
- maw-muter starts on script startup now to reduce first mute delay.
