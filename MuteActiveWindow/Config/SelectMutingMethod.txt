CHANGE FIRST LINE FROM 1 to 2 IF YOU WISH TO CHANGE MUTING METHOD

1 = maw-muter.exe 
(open source, little bit faster when it comes to muting, doesnt mute microphone in some applications/games)
You can check source code in my repo: https://github.com/tfurci/maw-muter

2 = svcl.exe
(closed source, works great but mutes all active instances which include microphone in some games/apps and can result in mic popping sound)
